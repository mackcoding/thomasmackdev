            About me
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-base-content/90 leading-relaxed">
            <p>My name is Thomas Mack, and I am a self‑taught computer enthusiast. At around the age of twelve, I immersed myself in computers thanks to gaming—while exploring a 2D MMO, I discovered its built‑in scripting engine and level editor. Fascinated, I spent several years designing custom levels and programming NPC behaviors using that game's scripting language.</p>

            <p>A few months later, I transitioned into web development with ASP Classic (VBScript) backed by Microsoft Access. I built and maintained multiple sites—ranging from a Zelda fan community to my personal portfolio, and eventually a paid website for a local business. During that period, I also gained hands‑on experience with Visual Basic 6, creating desktop utilities and automations.</p>

            <p>Over time, I expanded into modern technologies: once I began writing in C#, I ported many of my earlier projects to ASP .NET, applying object‑oriented principles and leveraging a more robust framework. After several proof‑of‑concept applications, I joined a web‑hosting company, where I shifted my focus to infrastructure. There, I acquired skills in Linux and Windows Server administration, ColdFusion hosting, system administration, and network management—capabilities that underpin my current work.</p>

            <p>These days, I'm broadening my toolkit with Go and Python while leveraging Ansible for automation. I'm fully immersed in Kubernetes, building and operating containerized platforms in production environments.</p>

            Homelab & Colocated
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-base-content/90 leading-relaxed">
            <p>I host my primary infrastructure at Linode and InterServer.net. On Linode, I operate Proxmox Mailgateway for email filtering, a dedicated mail server, and an Omni management node. At InterServer, a dedicated Proxmox host runs my Kubernetes control plane and worker node within LXC containers—one of which serves as a VPN gateway. Additionally, three virtual machines on that server function as high‑availability control planes, and a storage‑optimized VM runs Proxmox Backup Server alongside an S3‑compatible object store for backups.</p>

            <p>Locally, my homelab includes a Proxmox VE cluster that hosts an Unraid node for media and storage workloads, a Kubernetes worker node for cluster expansion, and several test machines for experimenting with new infrastructure patterns and software stacks.</p>

            About this website
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-base-content/90 leading-relaxed">
            <p>This website is developed using ASP .NET, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and JavaScript. While its design is straightforward, it features a contact form that writes submissions to a SQL database and sends them via email, as well as a basic analytics system that logs page views. In the near future, I plan to integrate a blog aggregator to pull posts from external sources via APIs.</p>

            <p>I leveraged AI‑assisted tools to refine the design process—this is my first Tailwind CSS project (I usually work in Bootstrap)—and to improve my writing. I did not use AI to generate the entire page or produce its code.</p>

            <p>Although the code is intended to be fully open source <a href="https://github.com/mackcoding/thomasmackdev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link link-info">here</a>, the repository has not yet been published. The site is secured behind Cloudflare—only traffic routed through Cloudflare's network is accepted, and direct IP access on ports 80 and 443 is blocked to enhance security.</p>
